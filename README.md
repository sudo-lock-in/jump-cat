My solo project for the second phase of SEO FYA! Play as a cat and jump over enemy dogs. Inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV8TNrwqG1Y and other endless runner games (e.g. Subway Surfers, Temple Run). Use arrow keys to move left/right and jump. Space key to start game. Double space to restart game after un-aliving. Your score increases as each bad dog goes off screen. If you bump into a dog, you un-alive and have to restart. Simplistic and fun! Targetted for a younger demographic. The game has RNG which makes it more challenging; the dogs have a different spacing each time they come back on screen, rather than the same predictable pattern. Challenges found while coding (which were overcome): logic errors regarding game screen bounds, too large hitboxes, game being almost impossible due to bad scaling, and detecting image collisions. Unfortunately, I could not add this song in time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hweqfxsrgac (a missing feature I wanted to add the most). Overall, I learnt a lot while working on this and pygame is pretty cool. I used online resources for the graphics, CTTO.
